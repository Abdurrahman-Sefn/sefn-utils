# Contributing

This is a personal showcase project, but feedback and suggestions are welcome!

## Guidelines

- Code should follow C++17 standard or later
- Keep the header-only design (no implementation files)
- Maintain consistent naming: PascalCase for files/classes, camelCase for functions
- Write clear, concise documentation
- Include examples for new features

## Building Examples

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./example
```

## Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 100 characters where practical
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
